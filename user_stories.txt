Bootstrap
    As a developer, I want to have a place where I can build and test my component.
    Tasks:
        - Set up simple web app with a demo page to play around in.

Show spaces
    As a simple Podio user, I want to see a list of spaces that I have access to
    Tasks:
    - Render markup for spaces and organizations from JSON
    - Apply basic styling
    - Toggle list on/off

Filter spaces
    As an advanced Podio user with many spaces, I want to be able to easily find the space I need.
    Tasks:
    - Add search box
    - Filter inputs when user types in the search box

Select using arrow keys
    As an advanced Podio user, I want to have super fast access to switch between my spaces.
    Tasks:
    - Handle moving up/down with arrow-keys in space search results.
    - Automatically return to search field when additional text is typed while navigating spaces.
    - Handle default selection of first search result, so the user can just press enter when the desired spaces is found.

Support scrolling on long lists
    As a Podio user, I don't want to have my UI obscured by very long lists of spaces
    Tasks:
    - Ensure that search results do not extend beyond the visible window.
    - Wrap search results in a scrollable div. Search input field should always be visible.
